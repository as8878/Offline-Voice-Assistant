# Offline Voice Assistant using Whisper + Ollama + ChatterBox

## Project Overview

This project implements a fully offline, real-time voice assistant that combines automatic speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), all running locally without requiring any cloud services. The assistant can listen, understand, and respond to user queries in natural conversation, similar to virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, but entirely offline and customizable.

Key features include:

* Real-time voice interaction
* Personalized voice cloning
* Emotionally expressive responses
* Fully offline execution on consumer hardware
* End-to-end modular pipeline

## System Architecture

The architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Speech Recognition (ASR):**

   * Whisper (OpenAI) is used to transcribe live speech input into text.
   * Supports multiple languages and accents with robust performance.

2. **Language Understanding (LLM):**

   * LangChain is used as the interface for conversational flow.
   * Ollama serves fine-tuned LLaMA-2 models locally for natural language understanding, dialogue, and response generation.

3. **Speech Synthesis (TTS):**

   * ChatterBox TTS from Resemble AI is used for generating lifelike speech.
   * Supports voice cloning, emotion control, and expressive responses.

The complete workflow:
**Speech Input → Whisper ASR → LLaMA-2 via LangChain → ChatterBox TTS → Audio Output**

## Setup Instructions
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

### 2️⃣ Install & Setup Ollama

Follow instructions at [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) to install Ollama.
Pull your preferred model:

```bash
ollama pull llama2
```

### 3️⃣ Start Application

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Voice Cloning

Record a 10-30 second clean voice sample:

```bash
python app.py --voice path/to/voice_sample.wav
```

### Emotion Control

```bash
python app.py --exaggeration 0.7 --cfg-weight 0.3
```

* **Exaggeration:** Controls emotional expressiveness (0.3-0.9).
* **CFG Weight:** Controls pacing (0.3-0.7).

### Model Selection

```bash
python app.py --model llama2
```

## Key Implementation Details

* Whisper ASR for real-time transcription
* LLaMA-2 (via Ollama) for dialogue reasoning
* LangChain for conversational memory and flow control
* ChatterBox TTS for personalized voice output and emotional expression
* Fully local deployment without internet or API keys
